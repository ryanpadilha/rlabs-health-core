Vulcano Health Core Library API Monitor for Microservices.<br>
This maven-component-library is used on monitored services by <b>[Vulcano Health Check API Monitor Project](https://github.com/ryanpadilha/vulcano-health-check-monitor)</b>.<br><br>
The goal is include additional features to help monitor and manage applications when it's on production environment.<br>
Basically we have, on this version, four endpoints with essential information:

- /health - check if the service is running correctly with all internal and external dependencies.
- /info - show details about version.
- /properties - list all application properties.
- /environment - relate all system environment variables of service context.

### Requirements

- Java 1.8 or later.
- Maven 3.x or later.

## Example of usage in Java

The health resource endpoint class implementation.

```java

@RouteResource(path = "/api/service")
public class HealthResourceImpl implements HealthResource {

	private static final String DB_IDENTITY = "db-postgres";

	@Override
	@Route(path = "/health", method = Method.GET)
	public ApplicationHealthWrapper health() {
		final Health applicationHealth = new ApplicationHealthIndicator().health(DependencyType.INTERNAL);
		final ApplicationHealthWrapper wrapper = new ApplicationHealthWrapper(applicationHealth);

		try {
			DataSourceHealthIndicator databaseIndicator = new DataSourceHealthIndicator(DB_IDENTITY,
					ConnectionFactory.getDataSource());
			wrapper.addDependency(DB_IDENTITY, databaseIndicator.health(DependencyType.EXTERNAL));
		} catch (Exception e) {
			wrapper.addDependency(DB_IDENTITY, Health.down(e).build());
		}

		return wrapper;
	}

	@Override
	@Route(path = "/info", method = Method.GET)
	public Info info() {
		return Info.buildFromPOM(WplacesServiceApplication.class);
	}

	@Override
	@Route(path = "/properties", method = Method.GET)
	public Property properties() {
		// TODO read-config manually, in future process automatically
		return Property.readProperties(Constants.getAllProperties());
	}

	@Override
	@Route(path = "/environment", method = Method.GET)
	public Environment environment() {
		return Environment.readSystemVariables();
	}

}

```

### JSON response datamodel

```json
{
    "application": {
        "status": "UP",
        "type": "INTERNAL",
        "details": {
            "response.timestamp": 1504211410427,
            "response.timestamp.utc": "31/08/2017 17:30:10"
        }
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "db-postgres": {
            "status": "UP",
            "type": "EXTERNAL",
            "details": {
                "database": "PostgreSQL",
                "database.version": "9.6.2",
                "database.statement": "OK"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
